The game will switch between different time scales, depending on the current position of the story. Here are the main time scales that will be used:
- **Quick-Time**
	- This is an optional tool that can be used to push the stress of a situation, where you force a fixed time scale instead of letting it change dynamically. Set a timer face-up and force the players to solve a problem in the same time their characters have, facing a consequence if they fail to do so.
- **10-Second Turns**
	- This is used during combat or other stressful situations that require quick, simultaneous actions between player characters.
	- See [Combat](/Mechanics/Combat.md)
- **Dynamic Time**
	- This is the time scale used during exploration and social encounters, it is approximately real-time but will include frequent small time-skips and slowdowns.
- **Shifts**
	- This is used for time skips longer than a few hours, including during rests.
	- See [Shifts](/Mechanics/Additional%20Rules.md#Shifts)
- **Days**
	- When players will be taking many shifts in a row.
	- See [Spending Days](/Mechanics/Additional%20Rules.md#Spending%20Days)
- **Downtime**
	- When players are spending weeks or months outside of an adventure, allow them to describe what their characters are working on, and allowing them to complete very large projects. XP isn't earned during this time, but money can be and large projects such as building a ship, making contacts, and building businesses can be done. Model this as you see fit.

## Finding Players
When putting together a game, it is important to find players who work well together. Ideally they will already be friends or at least know each other, but TTRPGs can be a great way to meet new people. As a GM, you are encouraged to think about what kind of game you want to run when choosing players. Some groups will spend a lot of time chatting instead of playing, or going of on silly tangents, while others will be very into the story of the game and spend a lot of effort working on their character and roleplaying. Its good to get players that have a similar expectation to each other, and to you. It is also recommended to ensure you have a balance of genders among your players, if possible.
## Safety Tools
Before starting a story, ensure that all players are on the same page about what content is acceptable in the game. Below is a standard agreement, but ensure it works with your players. You may also need to loosen some of these restrictions in order to accommodate the themes you intend to express, or tighten them for younger or more sensitive players.
- Violence and death are allowed, but no overly gruesome descriptions
- Implications of sex are allowed, but no details
- No sexual violence, and minimal "creepyness"
- No self-harm, and no suicide except in context
- No in-game transphobia, and no racism among humans

Also talk to your players about any other phobias or sensitive issues.
## Campaign Phases
A campaign can be split into phases, each of which might be a larger mission or several smaller ones. Generally changes in phases come with changes between piloting a spacecraft and adventuring in a station or on a planet or moon. They may come with changes in allies or enemies, switching the focus of the characters. Ideally, stories will come to natural conclusions and players will be motivated themselves to move on, but if a particular phase seems like it will go beyond about three - four sessions you should try to push it to wrap up. This keeps the story fresh and gives the players a chance to explore the world.

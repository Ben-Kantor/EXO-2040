## V1 - Pre-Alpha

### Theme
This game can be used to express many messages, including anti-capitalist and anti-fascist ideas, but its core theme is Absurdism. Absurdism is the belief that the universe is irrational and lacks inherent meaning, but rather than despairing at this truth like Nihilism, Absurdism instead celebrates the freedom and joy that come from creating meaning in a meaningless world.

The setting reflects this: it is a positive and uplifting world where characters carve out lives amidst chaos and share their joy with others. Even darker places are filled with hope and potential for improvement. Players should see their actions leave a tangible, positive impact on the world.
### Local Rules
Rather than designing sweeping rules that cover a broad range of possibilities, in many cases this game has more exact, local rules. For instance how each weapon includes rules as to how it is used. The downside of this is that the rules are much less rigorous, but this is accepted as this game relies much more heavily on GM discretion.

Also, in many cases a rule will say "usually" or "mostly" leaving the exact interpretation unclear. What this means is that by default this is true, but certain exceptions that should be obvious to the GM might change this, and the game is not going to try to make strict rules for them.

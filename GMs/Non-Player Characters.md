### Stat Blocks
To build the stat block of an NPC, first set their attributes. An average human as the values 2, 1, 1, 0, divided up between the four. A security guard, skilled merchant, artisan, or other above average person might be 3, 2, 1, 1. Highly trained enemies might use 3, 3, 2, 1. 

Then they should have 2-3 relevant skills. If they are used to combat they will have a weapon and a matching soldier skill and high attribute. Often more trained combats will have multiple weapons and armor.

Then set their resistances as 5 + the relevant attribute. For more powerful enemies, they can have all their resistances increased by 1 and one or more features to reinforce their role in the story. 

Rather than having NPCs make consciousness checks, just give them a fixed number of damage points after which they fall unconscious. For a base number, take 8 + the total of all their attributes.

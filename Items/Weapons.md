##### Range
- How many meters away the weapon can reach.
- If the weapon is ranged, it may be used at twice the range with a -1 penalty, triple the range with a -2 penalty, ...
- Some weapons can be thrown with a -1 penalty at a range of 5m.
##### Rate
- How many times the weapon can be used per turn. Each use still requires an action.
##### Modifier
- What attribute and skill are used to make the attack, and possibly a constant bonus or penalty.
- Total this up when you add a weapon to your character sheet and write down the final number.
##### Resistance
- When Resistance score is used to reduce the damage for the defender.
- On your character sheet put this down as Strength, Dexterity, Intellect, or Presence
##### Special Ability

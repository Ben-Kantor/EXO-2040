### Shifts
In non-urgent situations, the game progresses in 4-hour intervals called **Shifts**. During each Shift, players take turns deciding what their characters do and resolving those actions mechanically. Below are some ways a shift can be spent.
##### Resting
Characters can rest once every 20 hours, requiring one ration per character. A successful rest reduces the character’s damage to half (round up).
##### Performing a Medicate Check
A character trained in medicine can make an **Intellect + {Medicate}** check against difficulty 10. On success, one character can heal down to 1/3 damage after their next rest. Characters have disadvantage when attempting to heal themselves. The one being healed must spend their shift resting or engaging in a stationary activity. While in a population center, this service can be purchased for ₮5.
##### Crafting
Players can craft items, gadgets, or weapons if they have the necessary materials and skills.
##### Ship Modification
Characters with technical expertise can perform modifications or repairs on the ship, upgrading its capabilities or fixing damage.
##### Spending XP
Characters can allocate experience points to improve skills, abilities, or attributes.
##### Research or Study
If the players gain access to books, schematics, or data they need, they may need to spend several shifts studying it. This can sometimes require repeated checks until achieving a set number of successes.
##### Keeping Watch
While characters are resting, it is usually prudent for at least one character to keep watch. This involves making a **Presence + {Recon}** check.
##### Earning Money
Characters can find temporary work. A skill check determines how much they earn during the Shift.
##### Trade
Buying and selling goods in the marketplace. No more than one significant transaction is allowed per Shift.
##### Carousing
Socializing, gathering rumors, or building connections with the locals.
##### Gambling
Choose an amount of money to gamble, then make a check to see how much you lose/gain. Can also be modeled by a mini-game if several people characters go together.

### Spending Days
When the party spends several days in a population center or travels aboard a ship, the game can transition to a broader timescale. Each **day** represents a full cycle of activity and rest, during which every character can:
- Complete up to three Shifts’ worth of activities.
- Spend time on recreation or leisure.
- Get a full rest, halving damage as usual.
This system provides flexibility, allowing detailed play during key moments and efficient pacing during extended downtime.

### Contacts
Contacts are NPCs that a player character has a connection to, providing support or access to specific resources. Players can note any NPC they meet as a contact, provided they ask their name and establish a way to contact them in the future.
##### Trust Levels
Contacts have four levels of trust, which increase as the PCs build rapport with them. These levels are visually represented by diamonds (◇◇◇), filled in as trust grows.
- **◇◇◇** – **Acquaintance:** You know this person, and they’re open to small deals or basic interactions, but they won’t take risks for you.
- **◆◇◇** – **Familiar Contact:** The contact has had positive experiences with you. They’re willing to take minor risks, share useful information, or engage in larger deals.
- **◆◆◇** – **Trusted Ally:** A strong and reliable relationship has formed. The contact trusts you, takes significant risks, and may share sensitive resources or information.
- **◆◆◆** – **Loyal Partner:** The bond is deep, built on loyalty or shared interests. The contact will prioritize your needs, take substantial risks, and provide critical aid when necessary.
##### Building and Losing Trust
A contact’s trust level can increase at most once per session, provided the players make a significant, positive interaction or deal with the contact. Small, routine interactions won't improve trust if the contact already has a high level of trust.

Trust can drop if players:
- Call in a significant favor without repayment.
- Fail to deliver on promises or deals.
- Lie to, betray, or endanger the contact.

### Buying & Selling

##### Finding a Merchant
For common items, finding a merchant is relatively easy in most locations. However, only certain rare items will be available in any given location. Player can choose to look for "any rare item."
- **Quick Purchase:** Players can buy an item at its base price without spending a Shift.
- **Bartering:** Bartering for better prices usually takes an entire Shift.
##### Bartering
When a merchant offers an item, they start with an initial price (typically the item’s base value). Players may counteroffer, then make a **Presence** check to negotiate the price, with a difficulty depending on how steep the offer is. Depending on the type of merchant, skills like **Barter** or **Persuade** may apply. On a success that price is met, on a failure a compromise is offered or the offer is rejected.
##### Selling an Item
When selling an item, the default price is half the item’s base value, but this can be increased through successful bartering.
### Advanced Character Creation
##### Customizing a Background
Players can replace features or contacts from their background with alternatives, provided they discuss it with the GM.
- **New Contacts or Features:** Any replacement must align with the character’s background and remain balanced within the game.
- **GM Discretion:** The GM has the final say on all changes and may decline requests without needing to provide a reason.

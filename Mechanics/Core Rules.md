### Attributes
Each creature has four attributes:
- Strength
- Dexterity
- Intellect
- Presence
These can be any value, but are 1 on average for humans. PCs start with 0-3 in each totaling to 7, but NPCs can have higher or lower values (including negatives).
### Skills
Characters have a number of skills from the list below, as determined by their Backgrounds.
These are listed on their sheet under their abilities. 
Whenever they make a check that relates to one of their skills, they can add +1 to their roll.

### Checks
To make a check, follow these steps:
1. Roll 2d6.
2. Add your relevant attribute (Strength, Dexterity, Intellect, or Presence).
3. Add +1 if you have a relevant skill that applies to the task, check with your GM.
4. Include any advantages or disadvantages applied to the situation (see below).

Each chech will have a 
Then give this result to the GM, and they will compare it to the difficulty they set for the check.
If you rolled at least the difficulty of the check, you succeed.
Failing by just one, or rolling the difficulty exactly could cause a partial success, and rolling way above the difficulty or way below will indicate an easier success or more spectacular failure.
See [Check Difficulties](Check%20Difficulties.md) for more information.
##### Group Checks
If multiple people are forced to perform a check together rather than just assisting one person, each character rolls, than the average of the highest and lowest roll is rounded up or down depending on the rest of the group's rolls (GM discretion) to determine the group's score.
##### Re-Rolling
If a character re-rolls one or both dice using an ability, they must take the new result unless they have another ability that lets them re-roll again.
##### Contested Checks
Sometimes two characters will roll against each other, if they get the same result they both must re-roll.
##### Setbacks
When a check is made in a situation where success is eventually possible, a failure might indicate some other setback rather than failure in the direct task itself.
##### Multi-Turn Checks
Sometimes when things are happening simultaneously a check will be split up into multiple parts. The check will have a total difficulty that needs to be reached, and each check you make adds up towards reaching the ultimate goal. However if a roll fails to meet a difficulty of 10, it is considered a failure, and does not contribute at all. After some number of failures, usually three, the Multi-Turn check may be completely failed. Multiple characters can work together on these checks.
##### Criticals
If the dice show a total of 2 "snake-eyes" or 12 "boxcars" the result is a critical, and has either a failure with a setback, or a complete, easy success. This is mostly left up to the GM as to how it works.
### Advantages/Disadvantages
Advantages and Disadvantages are situational bonuses and penalties given by the GM, based on the conditions of a check. When a check is made, all advantages and disadvantages are totaled and added to the check.
##### Advantage (+1 to roll)
Advantage occurs when the circumstances are favorable for the player attempting the check. For instance:
- A tool, device, or another player is actively aiding you in completing the task.
- The enemy or target you are engaging is hindered in some way (e.g., blinded, stunned, surprised, or grappled).
- You have prepared thoroughly or the environment naturally assists your task (e.g., navigating after studying a map, shooting from high-ground)
##### Disadvantage (-1 to roll)
A -1 penalty is applied to the check when conditions make success more difficult. For instance:
- You are trying to perform an action without the proper tools or equipment.
- The task is being attempted under stressful or hostile conditions (e.g., picking a lock while being shot at, building a shelter while in acid rain).
- The obstacle or enemy is at an advantage (e.g., a foe has cover, attacking in total darkness).
- You are hindered by an injury, exhaustion, or other debilitation.
### Items
Characters can hold up to 20 items, including multiples of small items. Items like armor, weapons, and special equipment can be added to the item panels on the character sheet, copying over regular details, in addition to the inventory list. 
### Gaining XP
Players should receive XP for every 1-2 hours of gameplay, every time they complete a major challenge or a few minor challenges. This XP can then be spent in the future according to [Spending XP](/Reference/Spending%20XP.md).
### Luck Points
At the start of each session, each player rolls 1d6. They get that many luck points this session, unless they had more points left over from the previous session in which case they keep that number. Then players can donate luck points to other who have fewer than them if they want, but in-game currency cannot be traded for these, as the points belong to the players not the characters. The GM may also grant luck points as a bonus.

There are two ways to spend Luck Points:
- After a player makes a roll, they can spend a number of luck points to re-roll a d6 with that number showing. For instance they could spend one point to re-roll a d6 that rolled a 1.
- Before making an action, a player may spend a luck point to ignore one point of action penalty, this is most useful when a character needs to take more actions then planned.

If a player really wants, they can use unspent XP instead of Luck Points, however this should be saved for desperate situations. This ability offers the characters an inherent advantage for being the protagonists of the story, no NPCs have luck points.
### Items
Each character can hold up to 10 items, with multiples of small items counting as one. Some items can be used an unlimited number of times, but others are consumables. All consumables are single-use, characters can only intake at most one consumable per day, resetting every 24 hours or on a rest. Some items such as armor, weapons, or advances items will need to be added to the Items boxes on the character sheet, to indicate they are currently equipped. This includes items which don't use have a range, modifier, resistance, or rate.
##### Advanced Items
Advanced items are a type of armor, weapons, or other utility items that require training to use. A number of XP and shifts must be spent learning to use the item, and then it can be added to the training section on the character sheet. In some cases untrained items can be used with disadvantage, but not for the long term. 
##### Weapons
Each weapon will have several different values that determine its unique properties. These can be copied down when you add the weapon to your character sheet.
- Range
	- How many meters away the weapon can reach.
	- If the weapon is ranged, it may be used at twice the range with single disadvantage, three times range with double disadvantage, etc...
- Rate
	- How many times the weapon can be used per turn, each time it is used takes an action. 
- Modifier
	- What attribute and skill are used to make the attack, and possible a constant bonus or penalty.
	- Total this up when you add a weapon to your character sheet and write down the final number.
- Resistance
	- When Resistance score is used to reduce the damage for the defender.
	- On your character sheet put this down as Strength, Dexterity, Intellect, or Presence
- Special Ability
	- Any special mechanics or abilities of the weapon, write this down in the big empty box in the item panel on your character sheet.

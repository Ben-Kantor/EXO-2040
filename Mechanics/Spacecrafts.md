### Transit
When moving around in the solar system consult this table, for "bands" of the solar system.

| Solar Space | Mercury | Venus | Earth | Mars | Belt | Jupiter | Saturn | Uranus | Neptune | Kuiper Belt | Deep-Space |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1           | 2       | 3     | 4     | 5    | 6    | 7       | 8      | 9      | 10      | 11          | 12         |
Moving up and down between bands costs 1 unit of fuel and takes as many days as the band number you are moving too, divided by two rounded up. Each belt is divided up radially into a number of sections equal to its number, it takes 1 day and 1 unit of fuel to move to the next section.

Slowing to rendezvous or dock with another ship that is not travelling in the same direction costs and additional unit of fuel, but takes no extra time.
### Ship Stats & Modules
Each ship has a ship stat block, which includes:
- Max Damage - amount of damage before disabled
- Fuel usage (how many units of )
- Number of module bays
- A speed boost value of 0-4, used in chases

Small ships will have 1-2 upgrade bays, large ones can have 30-40, each bay can include weapons, trubo engines, upgraded communication and sensors, or many other things, but usually are just storage space. Some modules use several module bays, such as shuttle bays and heavy artillery. Each module takes a shift to install, and buying modules costs ₮10-40, storage modules just use ₮5 of materials. Cargo bays lose pressurization when disabled.

Mercury is inhabited by metallic lizard-like people who are 2.5-3 meters tall. They live in caves under the surface of Mercury, and are extremely resistant to pressure and temperature, as well as being extremely dangerous. They communicate through deep vibrations in the ground, but can speak. They have sharp claws and extremely tough metal scales. They have been encountered flying open spacecraft in deep space, and are almost always hostile. There are no formal relations with the Commonwealth, but conflict is avoided as long as human ships don't pass near the orbit of Mercury. Some Mercurians work as mercenaries in the Belt and outer solar system.

Reports have indicated presence of strange readings from the surface of the sun, suggesting intelligent gaseous life, but they don't respond to radio communication, and direct contact has not been attempted due to the danger and the risk of provoking war with the Mercurians. Ships without heat-shielding modules will begin to suffer damage while within the orbit of Mercury, and for each half of that distance another module will be required.

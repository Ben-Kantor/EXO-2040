//each background must grant:
- a contact, starting item, or other impermanent advantage
- a skill
- a ?????? - OR - a second skill

- Each background has four categories: background, 1, 2, 3.
- Characters get background and level 1 when they start with the discipline as a background
- Can buy 2 and 3 from there
- Other characters can buy into the discipline, but don't get the background features
- Have a separate page for just purchasable backgrounds, separate folder for spending XP?
- This also has some issues with the ancestry backgrounds that need solving
//idea: have the level 2 feature of each background be a combat ability

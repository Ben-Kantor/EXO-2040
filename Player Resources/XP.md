## Gaining XP
Characters should receive one point of XP for approximately every hour of gameplay, every time they complete a major challenge or several minor challenges. This can then be added to the Total section of the XP box on their character sheet. Often the GM will reward this XP at the end of a session, rather than throughout it.
## Spending XP
Unlike other games, XP that is spent to gain a mechanical a +1 bonus must have an in-world explanation, rather that characters suddenly gaining new abilities. This usually takes the form of a character practicing something, receiving training, or otherwise receiving the improvement. Most which you spend XP will take one shift, spend practicing, training, or otherwise. After doing this, mark down how much was spent where on the **Spent XP** table on the character sheet.

The GM may also give leveled features as rewards after adventures, usually related to the content or a character they encountered on the adventure. This will remain as an option until someone spends the xp required to unlock it.
#### Skills
Gaining a new skill costs 2 XP, and takes one shift.
#### Expert Item Trainings
Some highly powerful items require training to use, this training can be gained by spending 5 XP. Once trained, add it to the Trainings section of the character sheet. Using an expert item without training is only possible in rare cases, and will likely impose a penalty or cost luck points.
#### Leveled Features
Each set of leveled features will have three levels, each of which must be bought in order. Each level costs 5 XP and takes one shift to gain. It is possible to have higher level features without ones before them, but you must have all previous disciplines already in order to train a new one with XP.

Tiered features are divided up into three categories, each of which represent one way in which a character can grow, and each of which have some of their own special rules which can be found on their respective pages.
- [Psionics](/Player%20Resources/Psionics.md) - Supernatural abilities through powerful mental focus.
- [Cybernetics](/Player%20Resources/Cybernetics.md) - Technologic enhancements to the user's body.
#### Background Features
You can also spend XP to unlock new [Background](./Backgrounds) features, though you don't get their base benefits. Each one costs 3 XP, and they must be unlocked in order. If you alread have a first level feature because it was one of your starting Backgrounds, you can work down from there.
#### Emergency Luck
XP can also be spent in the same way as Luck points, when this is done, note it down under the XP usage table.
#### Adding Contacts
Contacts can be added at the (◆◇◇) level for 3 XP, this represents a contact your character had previously but is only now choosing to use.

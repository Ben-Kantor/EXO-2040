## Gaining XP
Characters should receive one point of XP for every 1-2 hours of gameplay, every time they complete a major challenge or several minor challenges. This can then be added to the Total section of the XP box on their character sheet. 
## Spending XP
Unlike other games, XP that is spent to gain a mechanical advantage must have an in-world explanation. This usually takes the form of a character practicing something, receiving training, or otherwise receiving the improvement. Each way in which you spend XP will take a number of shifts spent until the benefit is gained, if not stated, assume the same number of Shifts as XP Points need to be spent. After doing this, mark down how much was spent where on the Spent XP table on the character sheet.
#### Skills
Each skill costs a number of XP equal to the number of skills you already have plus one, and will only take one shift. For instance a player's fifth skill costs 5 XP. As an exception, academic skills never cost more than 3 XP.
#### Special Abilities
After a particular adventure, the GM may offer special abilities that can be trained, relating to what was encountered on that adventure. These can be saved until used, but once trained by one player are used up.
#### Expert Items
Some highly powerful items require training to use, each of them describe the amount of XP and shifts that need to be spent to gain the necessary training to use them.
#### Enhancements
Cybernetics, or other bodily enhancements can be purchased for both XP and game currency, and grant features, skills, or attribute improvements.
#### Emergency Luck
XP can also be spent in the same way as Luck points, when this is done, note it down under the XP usage table.

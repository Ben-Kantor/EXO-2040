## Gaining XP
Characters should receive one point of XP for approximately every hour of gameplay, every time they complete a major challenge or several minor challenges. This can then be added to the Total section of the XP box on their character sheet. Often the GM will reward this XP at the end of a session, rather than throughout it.
## Spending XP
Unlike other games, XP that is spent to gain a mechanical a +1 bonus must have an in-world explanation, rather that characters suddenly gaining new abilities. This usually takes the form of a character practicing something, receiving training, or otherwise receiving the improvement. Each way in which you spend XP will take a number of shifts spent until the benefit is gained, if not stated, assume the same number of Shifts as XP Points need to be spent. After doing this, mark down how much was spent where on the Spent XP table on the character sheet.
#### Skills
Each skill costs 3 XP to unlock, and takes one shift to train. You may also train two skills of the same category for 5 XP during two shifts.
#### Expert Items
Some highly powerful items require training to use, this training can be gained by spending 5 XP and a shift to train.
#### Emergency Luck
XP can also be spent in the same way as Luck points, when this is done, note it down under the XP usage table.
#### Leveled Abilities
Most XP will be spent on leveled abilities, as they are the primary way of gaining new features. Each set of abilities will have three levels, each of which must be bought for 5 XP. Once the first level is bought, the second level may be bought, and then the third. To buy second level ability, a character must have at least 15 total XP, and to buy a third level ability they must have at least 30 total XP.

Tiered abilities are divided up into three categories, each of which have some of their own special rules.

# EXO-2040
Exo-2040 is a rules-light, retro-futuristic tabletop role-playing game inspired by the science fiction of the 19th and 20th centuries. The setting captures the imaginative vision of a bygone era, before our modern scientific understanding of the world, with a deliberately mysterious and wacky setting.
## Features
- A simple, flexible, 2d6 based [Dice System](/Rules/Checks.md).
- Unlinked skills, fit to the setting.
- A [Two-Background](Backgrounds.md) system, that offers character customization without overwhelming new players.
- A comprehensive system for [Spacecrafts](/Spacefaring/Spaceflight.md), with [Combat](/Spacefaring/Ship%20Combat.md) that doesn't leave players left out and [Upgrades](Modules.md) that allow the ship to improve with the characters.
- A highly extensible [XP System](XP.md) that allows GMs to incorporate their own ideas.
- Well-organized, accesible [Lore](/Setting/) to serve as a jumping-off point for GMs.
- An intralinked, sorted Markdown wiki, that is much quicker to navigate than a traditional manuscript.
- The ability for anyone to contribute, and a [License](License.txt) that allows anyone to use the game for future projects.

## Contributing
EXO-2040 is an intralinked markdown wiki, written and edited using Obsidian and published on Github. If you want to suggest changes, fork the repository, make your changes using the online or a local editor, then submit a pull request to have your changed merged into the game. Below are the basic principles of the game source.
#### Expansible Mechanics
- Gameplay systems should all expand on the core of the system (attributes, skills, 2d6 checks, etc...), as well as on other mechanics, and should leave room to be expanded upon.
- Mechanics should also use common themes, for instance the values of the values 3, 5, 7, and 10 are far preferred to other numbers.
#### Trust the GM
- Rather than require strict detail on how things work in each exact circumstance, the GM can be trusted to determine the correct course.
- Sometimes multiple methods of ruling can be provided with the GM free to choose, other time a "usually" or "often" can be added, implying that in some cases the GM will need to improvise another route.
#### Formatting
- Pages should contain a maximum of 1500 words, pages larger then that need to be split.
- The [Markdown Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html) should be followed, except for the spaces after lines and empty rows before and after headers, both of which can be skipped.
- For rules and lore pages, h2 headers should be used, with optional h4 subheaders.
- For list pages, h3 headers should be used, sometimes with an italic line after them adding flavor.
- Bullet points should be used for lists, or sets of independent rules/facts.
	- Lines should not be indented by more then one column from the main list.
	- Leave an empty line between the last bullet point and paragraph text.
- Lines can be separated by a dash to indicate an explanation, with the first part bolded.

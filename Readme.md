# EXO-2040
Exo-2040 is a rules-light, retro-futuristic tabletop role-playing game inspired by the science fiction of the 19th and 20th centuries. The setting captures the imaginative vision of a bygone era, before our modern scientific understanding of the world, with a deliberately mysterious and wacky setting.

## Features
- A simple, flexible, 2d6 based [Dice System](/Rules/Checks.md), fit to the setting.
- A [Two-Background](/Players/Backgrounds.md) system, that offers character customization without overwhelming new players.
- A comprehensive system for [Spacecrafts](/Spacefaring/Spaceflight.md), with [Combat](/Spacefaring/Ship%20Combat.md) that doesn't leave players left out and [Upgrades](/Spacefaring/Modules.md) that allow the ship to improve with the characters.
- A highly extensible [XP System](/Players/XP.md) that allows GMs to incorporate their own ideas.
- Well-organized, accesible [Lore](/Setting/) to serve as a jumping-off point for GMs.
- An intralinked, sorted Markdown wiki, that is much quicker to navigate than a traditional manuscript.
- The ability for anyone to contribute, and a [License](License.txt) that allows anyone to use the game for future projects.

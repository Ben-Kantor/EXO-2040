## Skills
Characters have a number of skills from the list below, as determined by their Backgrounds.
These are listed on their sheet under their abilities. 
Whenever they make a check that relates to one of their skills, they can add +1 to their roll.

## Checks
To make a check, follow these steps:
1. Roll 2d6.
2. Add your relevant attribute (Strength, Dexterity, Intellect, or Presence).
3. Add +1 if you have a relevant skill that applies to the task, check with your GM.
4. Include any advantages or disadvantages applied to the situation (see below).

Then give this result to the GM, and they will compare it to the difficulty they set for the check. If you rolled at least the difficulty of the check, you succeed. Failing by just one, or rolling the difficulty exactly could cause a partial success, and rolling way above the difficulty or way below will indicate an easier success or more spectacular failure. See [Check Difficulties](/GMs/Check%20Difficulties.md) for more information.
#### Contested Checks
Sometimes two characters will roll against each other, if they get the same result they both must re-roll.
#### Setbacks
When a check is made in a situation where success is eventually possible, a failure might indicate some other setback rather than failure in the direct task itself.
#### Criticals
If the dice show a total of 2 "snake-eyes" or 12 "boxcars" the result is a critical, and has either a failure with a setback, or a complete, easy success. This is mostly left up to the GM as to how it works.
#### Re-Rolling
If a character re-rolls one or both dice using an ability, they must take the new result unless they have another ability that lets them re-roll again.
#### Group Checks
If multiple people are forced to perform a check together rather than just assisting one person, each character rolls, than the average of the highest and lowest roll is rounded up or down depending on the rest of the group's rolls (GM discretion) to determine the group's score. The GM can narrate how the character who rolled the best helped out the others, or how the character who rolled the worst failed.
#### Skill Challenges
Sometimes check will be split up into a Skill Challenge, usually when the check is either very important, or taking place during combat and will take more than one turn. To start, an attribute, skill, and difficulty are chosen as normal, with the difficulty usually being 10-12. Then rather then making one check, the character must repeat the check until they have three successes or failures. With three successes the skill challenge is successful, with three failures, the check is entirely failed and impossible to retry.

GMs should narrate the checks to explain each step that is needed. During combat only one attempt at any skill challenge can be made per turn. Some skill challenges may require more or less than three successes.
#### Secret Checks
Sometimes a character might make a check in such a way that they won't know whether or not it succeeded. In this case the player must act as their character would, without considering the result of the dice. The GM may choose to make such checks secretly, but if so should ask the player before rolling whether they would be willing to spend a luck point to re-roll a 1 on the check, if it is spent, they immediately tell the player so they can mark it down. 
## Advantages/Disadvantages
Advantages and Disadvantages are situational bonuses and penalties given by the GM, based on the conditions of a check. When a check is made, all advantages and disadvantages are totaled and added to the check.
#### Advantage (+1 to roll)
Advantage occurs when the circumstances are favorable for the player attempting the check. For instance:
- A tool, device, or another player is actively aiding you in completing the task.
- The enemy or target you are engaging is hindered in some way (e.g., blinded, stunned, surprised, or grappled).
- You have prepared thoroughly or the environment naturally assists your task (e.g., navigating after studying a map, shooting from high-ground)
#### Disadvantage (-1 to roll)
A -1 penalty is applied to the check when conditions make success more difficult. For instance:
- You are trying to perform an action without the proper tools or equipment.
- The task is being attempted under stressful or hostile conditions (e.g., picking a lock while being shot at, building a shelter while in acid rain).
- The obstacle or enemy is at an advantage (e.g., a foe has cover, attacking in total darkness).
- You are hindered by an injury, exhaustion, or other debilitation.

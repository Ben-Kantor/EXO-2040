## Initiative
When combat or another rushed encounter begins, have each player roll 2d6 + dex, whoever rolls highest (reroll on tie) goes first. Then play proceeds around the table (alternate directions), with the GM playing any monsters when it gets to them. If one character initiates the encounter themselves, they go first; if the players are taken by surprise by the enemies, the GM goes first. Each round is considered to take ten seconds in-game.
## Basic Actions
At the start of their turn, players declare how many actions they are taking, up to three.
Each action that involves a dice roll gets -1 for each action more than one that they are taking this turn.
This is called the **Action Penalty**, and means if you take three actions in a turn, each one gets -2 on the roll.
Actions that do not require a roll can ignore this, however.
- **Light Punch** - Make a Dexterity + {Martial Arts} check, deal that much damage to an enemy within 1m, minus their Strength resistance.
- **Heavy Punch** - Make a Strength + {Martial Arts} check, deal that much damage to an enemy within 1m, minus their Dexterity resistance.
- **Other Weapon Attack** - Other [Weapons](/Items/Weapons.md) will describe how an attack works, you can't use more than one weapon per turn.
- **Interact with Object** - You can usually only interact with the same object once per turn, and if the interaction requires a check it will be effected by the Action Penalty
- **Move** - Move somewhere, this can just mean running, or climbing, swimming, etc. One move action covers about 10m of ground, though in more difficult terrain it might be 5m or less. If the movement requires difficult climbing or other skills, a **{Move}** check may be required.
- **Assist** - Offer help to a check someone else is about to make, granting them advantage if you have an attribute of three or higher or a skill relevant to the check.
- **Skill Challenges** - Working on a [Skill Challenge](/Rules/Checks.md#Multi-Turn%20Checks.md), can only be done once per turn.
- **Block, Dodge, Concentrate, Meditate** - Increase one of your resistances by one until next turn.
- **Stand up from Prone**
- **Use a Consumable**
## Free Actions
Free actions are things a character can do during initiative without spending an action, and that can happen during other people's turns. You generally can't take the same Free Action multiple times during a turn cycle, unless you spend an action.
- **Drop Prone** - Drop to the ground in the prone position, or stand up from it.
- **Change Items** - Put up to one item they are holding away, and then draw up to one item from their inventory.
- **Communicate** - Say something short to another character.
- **Step** - Move up to 3m, this can't be done if you are also taking a move action, or in difficult terrain.
## Holding Actions
If a character wants to take an action outside of their turn, they can choose to hold an action. This happens after they declare how many actions they are taking, and after they are done with any other actions they want to take. They can use this one action whenever they like during the turn cycle, and it has the same action penalty as the other actions they took during their turn. If initiative comes all the way back to them, they get to take that one action before starting their turn.

Alternatively, two players may switch seats to change the initiative position of their characters.
## Resistances
Each attribute also serves as a damage reduction for a given type of damage, in the range of 5-10. This is usually equal to the attribute plus 7. All damage of that type is reduced by that much, negative abilities count as 0, and damage can be reduced to nothing.

| Ability   | Damage                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Strength  | Light, quick attacks; ranged attacks. |
| Dexterity | Heavy, slow attacks; falling objects. |
| Intellect | Energy weapons, fire, lightning.      |
| Presence  | Psychic, mental damage                |
Resistances can also be increased by wearing [Armor](Checks.md#Armor) [(List)](/Items/Armors.md), or by some enhancements.
## Taking Damage
When damage is dealt to a character, it is added to their previous total damage, which starts at 0. This number can be tracked in the big Damage Taken box on the character sheet. Then if they have seven or more total damage they must make a **consciousness check**. To do so, they roll a Strength check, against half the total number of damage they have taken (round up). 
- If they succeed, nothing happens.
- If they fail, they fall unconscious.
- If they fail by 7 or more, they fall into a coma.
## Status Conditions
#### Unconscious
 While a character is unconscious, If the amount of damage they have decreases while they are unconscious, they may re-roll and wake up on a success. If the amount of damage increases, they must re-roll to see if they fall into a coma, but they don't wake up on a success. Without interference, unconscious characters will wake up after 1 hour.
#### Comatose
Characters in a coma are unable to communicate and do not make consciousness checks as normal, instead every 24 hours they make a coma check (Strength vs half of total damage):
- If they succeed, they wake up.
- If they fail, they take one additional injury.
- If they fail by seven or more or role snake-eyes, and have more injuries than total xp, they die.

While in a coma, the same  item can't be used more than once, and heal checks do nothing. To wake up, they will need advanced healing from a medical center, and then electroshock therapy to wake them up.
#### Prone
While prone, characters have a disadvantage on attacks and some physical checks, and attacks against them have an advantage. Moving the same distance that would normally take one move action instead requires two move actions. They can stand up form prone as an action. 
#### Blinded
Characters who are blinded get disadvantage on attacks and other checks that require sight. This condition will usually be inflicted by an item or ability, and last a specified duration.
#### Others
Some other abilities will inflict other status conditions, they will always be described and have an end condition specified.
## Map Combat
For some complex encounters, the GM may decide to setup a map. The recommended way to do this is having a printed out or drawn map, and to use small markers. A virtual table-top can also be used, we recommend [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/). While doing combat on a map, squares or hexes may be used, each of which represents 1m. One move action lets a character move by 10m. Moving diagonally on grids counts as only 1m.

## Items
Each character can hold up to 10 items, with multiples of small items counting as one. Some items can be used an unlimited number of times, but others are consumables. All consumables are single-use, characters can only intake at most one consumable per day, resetting every 24 hours or on a rest. Some items such as armor, weapons, or advances items will need to be added to the Items boxes on the character sheet, to indicate they are currently equipped. This includes items which don't use have a range, modifier, resistance, or rate.
#### Advanced Items
Advanced items are a type of armor, weapons, or other utility items that require training to use. A number of XP and shifts must be spent learning to use the item, and then it can be added to the training section on the character sheet. In some cases untrained items can be used with disadvantage, but not for the long term. 
#### Weapons
Each weapon will have several different values that determine its unique properties. These can be copied down when you add the weapon to your character sheet.
- Range
	- How many meters away the weapon can reach.
	- If the weapon is ranged, it may be used at twice the range with single disadvantage, three times range with double disadvantage, etc...
- Rate
	- How many times the weapon can be used per turn, each time it is used takes an action. 
- Modifier
	- What attribute and skill are used to make the attack, and possible a constant bonus or penalty.
	- Total this up when you add a weapon to your character sheet and write down the final number.
- Resistance
	- When Resistance score is used to reduce the damage for the defender.
	- On your character sheet put this down as Strength, Dexterity, Intellect, or Presence
- Special Ability
	- Any special mechanics or abilities of the weapon, write this down in the big empty box in the item panel on your character sheet.
#### Armor
Some items, called armor, increase some of these resistances. One character cannot wear more than one piece of armor at a time.
## Luck Points
At the start of each session, each player rolls 1d6, and gains that many luck points up to a maximum of seven. Then players can donate luck points to other who have fewer than them if they want, but in-game currency cannot be traded for these, as the points belong to the players not the characters. The GM may also grant luck points as a bonus.

There are two ways to spend Luck Points:
- After a player makes a roll, they can spend a number of luck points to re-roll a d6 with that number showing. For instance they could spend one point to re-roll a d6 that rolled a 1.
- Before making an action, a player may spend a luck point to ignore one point of action penalty, this is most useful when a character needs to take more actions then planned.

If a player really wants, they can use unspent XP instead of Luck Points, however this should be saved for desperate situations. This ability offers the characters an inherent advantage for being the protagonists of the story, no NPCs have luck points.
## Contacts
Contacts are NPCs that a player character has a connection to, providing support or access to specific resources. Players can note any NPC they meet as a contact, provided they ask their name and establish a way to contact them in the future.
#### Trust Levels
Contacts have four levels of trust, which increase as the PCs build rapport with them. These levels are visually represented by diamonds (◇◇◇), filled in as trust grows.
- **◇◇◇** – **Acquaintance:** You know this person, and they’re open to small deals or basic interactions, but they won’t take risks for you.
- **◆◇◇** – **Familiar Contact:** The contact has had positive experiences with you. They’re willing to take minor risks, share useful information, or engage in larger deals.
- **◆◆◇** – **Trusted Ally:** A strong and reliable relationship has formed. The contact trusts you, takes significant risks, and may share sensitive resources or information.
- **◆◆◆** – **Loyal Partner:** The bond is deep, built on loyalty or shared interests. The contact will prioritize your needs, take substantial risks, and provide critical aid when necessary.
#### Building and Losing Trust
A contact’s trust level can increase at most once per session, provided the players make a significant, positive interaction or deal with the contact. Small, routine interactions won't improve trust if the contact already has a high level of trust.

Trust can drop if players:
- Call in a significant favor without repayment.
- Fail to deliver on promises or deals.
- Lie to, betray, or endanger the contact.

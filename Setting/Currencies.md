## Currencies
#### TSI
The main human currency is TSI (_Terran Square Inch_), pronounced "Tsai." Each unit represents one square inch of territory on Earth and is valued at about $5 or ¬£4. TSI are sometime traded in parts, usually decimal tenths. It is represented by ‚ÇÆ, for example, 3.2 TSI would be written as ‚ÇÆ3.2.

TSI are tracked and stored by the Human Commonwealth's Planetary Reserve. Many humans carry a tsi-card, an aluminum card used to make payments by touching it to another card or station. Tsi-cards are permanently linked to a specific account and display the value of the account on a small analog screen. They cannot be used unless they are near the implanted wrist chip of their owner.
#### Trilium
Trilium (helium-3) is the most widely accepted currency across the solar system. It is traded by the gram and is usually traded in small gas tanks, mostly with prices in powers of two, and never in fractions of a gram. One gram of it is represented by the symbol üúÅ. It also serves as the primary fuel for fusion spacecrafts. 8 Grams of Trillium is approximately equal to one Tsi. 
#### Zenth
The primary currency of the Meteor Belt is Zenth, tungsten coins minted from ten grams of tungsten each. Zenth coins are about the size of a quarter or ¬£1 piece and often have the insignia of a particular House stamped entirely through the coin. Costs in Zenth are often seemingly random numbers rather than round values.

Zenth are represented by "∆µ"; for instance, 15 Zenth would be written as ∆µ15. Five Zenth is roughly equivalent to 1 TSI, but this changes frequently with the value of Tungsten. Coins are frequently weighed on scales to verify authenticity, as counterfeiting is a known issue in the Meteor Belt.
## Measurements
All units should be in metric/SI, except force which is measured in gravity on earth. Time and date are the same, except instead of calendar months lunar months, 30 days long, are used.

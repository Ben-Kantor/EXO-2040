## The Martian Wars
In the 1965, the NASA Mariner VI and VII probes suddenly lost communication while flying by Mars. Sensors on Earth showed an energy pulse from the moment it was destroyed, originating from the Martian surface. Careful analysis of the their last readings indicate they were destroyed by an orbital weapon on the Martian moon of Deimos. Over the next few years multiple probes were launched and destroyed before reaching their destination, and a high energy burst originating from a Martian Citadel in deep space destroyed the Kennedy Space center.

It was soon after discovered that the Soviet Union had made contact with Mars soon after the destruction of Mariner, and had been aiding their attacks in exchange for powerful technology including the first ray-guns. Driven by this threat, the Americas, Western Europe, and various other parts of the world joined together to form the Human Commonwealth.

The Martian wars consisted of several brutal but short periods of war as the two planets launched huge barrages of weapons from afar. Each time the interplanetary weapons of both planets destroyed each other's stations, ships, and colonies. In the final barrage, the Earth space elevator Ascension was destroyed, crashing onto the planet, and the Martian moon of Deimos was shattered. That, along with millions of civilian casualties on both sides, caused both governments to finally make peace.

Before the space age, reports of people with supernatural mental powers were mostly disregarded, but when humanity began to travel into space, the number of reports increased massively. About one percent of humans exposed to radiation in the inner solar system develop psionic powers, usually around puberty. Those farther out in the system develop them at a much higher rate. Even without developing psionics, many humans can gain them through intense meditation and focus. Psionic powers are all blocked completely by tungsten, giving the metal its high value.

Martians have psionics much more frequently than humans, and many young human psionics train with Martian masters. Due to the prevalence of psionics, playing cards are often coated in a thin layer of tungsten to prevent cheating, and important documents are often held in tungsten-coated envelopes.

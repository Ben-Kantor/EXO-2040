## Ship Identifiers
Any large spacecraft (five or more module slots) must be registered, with a prefix and a name. Prefixes are three-letter initialisms placed before a ship name to indicate its affiliation and purpose. While the rules for prefixes are not strict and there is no central authority enforcing them, many planetary governments prohibit misuse of prefixes.
#### First Letter
The first letter indicates what domain of the system the craft operates from.
- B - Belt
- F - Free (Unaffiliated)
- G - Galilean (Jupiter's Moons)
- H - Human
- J - Jovian
- M - Martian
- N - Neptunian
- O - Outer (archaic term, means Belt)
- P - Plutonian
- R - Revolutionary / Red Union
- S - Saturnian
- U - Uranian
- V - Venusian
#### Second Letter
The second letter indicates the primary purpose of the craft. This is the least standardized category, and nearly any letter can be used. Here are some common examples:
- B - Battle
- C - Cargo
- D - Diplomatic 
- E - Exploratory
- L - Luxury
- M - Mining
- P - Patrol
- R - Rescue
- S - Scientific
- T - Transport
- W - War
- X - Experimental
- Z - Customs (Basic trade enforcement)
#### Third Letter
The third letter indicates the type of craft:
- S - Ship
- V - Vessel
- P - Post (station)
Other letters are sometimes used by military or official crafts.
#### Alternate Prefixes
This practice is frowned upon, but some mass-produced ships will be given a series name instead of a prefix (e.g., "warbird"),
#### Names
Ships can have any name, as long as the combination of the prefix and name are unique. Human ships commonly use historical or fictional names, with more sleek high-end ships usually receiving feminine names and cheaper more utilitarian ships usually receiving masculine names.
## Unregistered Crafts
Small crafts with less than 5 module slots do not need to registered, and usually use a title instead of a prefix (e.g., "shuttle", "runabout", "tugboat", "racer", "corvette").
## Transponders
Every registered ship and most unregistered ones have a transponder, a combination of a short-range transmitter and receiver. It constantly sends out the ships prefix and name, and provides a constant map of other nearby crafts within about 100km. Disabling or tampering with a transponder is a major offence in some domains of the solar system. Transponders can also transmit and receive text messages, voice transmissions, and data slowly.
## Terminology
- Spaceports are gravitational docking stations
- Spacedocks are zero-gravity docking stations
- Shuttles are small, slow ships with cargo space or passenger seats
- Corvettes are tiny, fast, agile, combat ships
- Tugboats are small but engine-filled ships for pulling large ships, debris, and asteroids
- Frigates are small, agile, heavily-armed ships
- Cruisers are large ships that carry heavy weapons
- Carriers are large ships that carry many smaller shuttles
- Battleships are huge ships that carry heavy weapons and deployable corvettes
## Command Structure
Each registered ship must have a captain and a first officer, and typically also has a chief engineer. Larger ships may have other official positions.

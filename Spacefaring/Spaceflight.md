## Understanding Spacecraft
- For spacecraft, the longest axis is usually top / bottom, with the helm at the top an the engine at the bottom.
- If a spacecraft doesn't have artificial gravity, most physical checks will be at disadvantage for everyone who isn't void-born.
#### Computators
All modern spacecrafts have a core computator terminal, used to plot routes. 
- Can solve basic math / physics problems at a cost of üúÅ each.
- Can send communications, setup beacons, control life support, etc...
- Can eject any module.
#### Transit
When moving around in the solar system consult this table, for "bands" of the solar system.

| Solar Space | Mercury | Venus | Earth | Mars | Belt | Jupiter | Saturn | Uranus | Neptune | Kuiper Belt | Deep Space |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1           | 2       | 3     | 4     | 5    | 6    | 7       | 8      | 9      | 10      | 11          | 12         |

Moving up and down between bands costs 1 unit of fuel and takes as many days as the band number you are moving too, divided by two rounded up. Each belt is divided up radially into a number of sections equal to its number, it takes 1 day and 1 unit of fuel to move to the next section.

Slowing to rendezvous or dock with another ship that is not travelling in the same direction costs and additional unit of fuel, but takes no extra time.
#### Ship Stats & Modules
Each ship has a ship stat block, which includes:
- Max Damage - amount of damage before disabled
- Fuel usage (how many units of )
- Ship Size (number of module bays
- A speed boost value of 0-4, used in chases

Small ships might have 3-5 upgrade bays, large ones can have 30-40 or more [(list)](Modules.md). Some modules use several module bays, such as shuttle bays and heavy artillery. Each module takes a shift to install, and buying modules costs ‚ÇÆ20-100.

If a slot is not used for a module, it is storage space, and can hold the same amount as a player's inventory (10 normal items or multiples of small items).
### Takeoff and Landing
Taking off and landing from a small body like The Moon takes 2 units, a larger body like Mars takes 3, and a body like Earth or Venus takes 4. Landing on a body with an atmosphere always takes 1, but bodies without atmosphere have the same landing cost as takeoff. Not all ships are capable of atmospheric takeoff and landing, or even non-atmospheric.

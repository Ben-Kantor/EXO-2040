## Stations
The largest deep-space station built by the Commonwealth is Ticonderoga Stations, a hollow Hexagon 1km wide in the L2 Lagrange point just outside of Earth's orbit. It is the central military outpost, and is slowly being disarmed and refitted as a public station for voidsteaders. 
## Spaceships
Commonwealth spaceships tend to look like large rectangular prisms with flattened edges bolted together. They are compartmentalized to survive even catastrophic failures. Many are repurposed military ships from the Martian Wars.
## Ascension II
A human space elevator built in Brazil. Ascension I was destroyed in a Martian attack. Carries Humans, goods, and small craft into high orbit, saving fuel costs and effort. At the top there is a large civilian station of the same name, including a giant gravity ring around the elevator, from before the discovery of arti-grav.

### Vessel Combat
When spacecrafts or spacecraft-sized combatants enter into a fight, a system called **Vessel Combat** is used. Simply, each object on the field has two resistances, **Armor** and **Shield** (instead of the four attributes), which start at 5 as a base but go up. Heavy metal panels that increases Armor Resistance tend to make vessels more conductive, and tend to reduce Shield. Ships can be damaged with Vessel Weapons, but normal forms of attack get -5 against them. Instead of taking injuries, vessels take Damage Points, eventually becoming disabled at a certain number, and potentially exploding beyond that. GMs are encouraged to improvise impairments in the Vessels function as it takes Damage Points.
##### Turn Order
During Vessel Combat, each player chooses one aspect of the ship for their character to be involved in. This could be piloting, repairing damage, firing a weapon, setting up a distress beacon, etc. Each turn they work with any other people also working on the same thing to decide what is done, then each person working makes a roll and the highest one is taken.
##### Chases
While two ships are in an encounter where relative speed matters, each time the character at the helm takes their turn, a roll is made to determine how fast the ship goes. This roll is 2d6 plus the ships speed boost value. If the pilot has a relevant pilot skill they can also add +1 to the roll.
### Damage Effects
Each ship will have a damage table that describes what happens as it suffers damage. When it suffers damage, roll 1d6 + damage taken + number of previous hits, and consult table, to see what effect is suffered. A [Multi-Turn Check](<Core Rules#Multi-Turn Checks>) will be required to solve the problem, with a difficulty described by the ships rules. Here is the base table for a small 6 person transport ship.

| Roll | Effect                                                                        |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <3   | Nothing                                                                       |
| 4    | Engine hit, -1 boost                                                          |
| 5    | Long Range Comms / Scanners disabled (choose one randomly)                    |
| 6    | Engine hit, -2 boost until fixed                                              |
| 7    | Oxygen leak, number of turns equal to number of module bays until suffocation |
| 8    | Shield resistance reduced by one                                              |
| 9    | Randomly selected module bay disabled                                         |
| 10   | Armor resistance reduced by one                                               |
| 11   | Boost disabled, fixed value of 5                                              |
| 12   | Randomly selected module bay destroyed, per five on ship                      |
| 13   | All sensors and comms disabled                                                |
| 14   | Movement completely disabled                                                  |
| 15   | All weapons completely disabled                                               |
For this ship, fixing any of these issues will require a multi-turn check with a total difficulty equal to twenty plus twice the total roll.

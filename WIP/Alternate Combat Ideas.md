Both would include a system of either combat advancements that can be purchased for 5XP each or a path of upgrades with a choice every 10XP. These allow each character to specialize and do more during combat, including healing abilities, psionic damaging, built-in weapons, etc.
### A 2d6 rolling table like draw steel
- Attributes are still added
- No weapon skills
- T1: 2-8, T2: 9-11, T3: 13+
- Each weapon has a different effect for each tier
	- T1 is a miss on ranged weapons, or only 1 damage on melee weapons
	- T2 is a normal hit, doing 2-4 damage
	- T3 does 1-2 more damage and causes an extra effect
- Armor is essentially gone, or offers a pool of "temp hp"
---
### A bonus effect on a 6
- Resistances changed to: Sharp, Blunt, Ranged, Energy
- Attacks work the same as they currently do
- Weapons have an extra effect that activates for each 6 rolled

### Other Ideas
- Actions each turn start at no penalty and stack -1, and something bad happens if you roll poorly enough in a "go as far as you dare" system, could be too gimmicky.
	 - Maybe you can attack until failure? Too swingy?

This is an optional WIP rule that grants better scaling to combat, as otherwise the only significant way to improve in combat is to get better items.

For every 10 XP spent anywhere, each character gains a new combat advancement, which is a type of feature. Advancements which are in a numbered list must be purchased in order. Combat advancements that require activating can be used once per combat.

- **Tenacity** - Your **{Melee}** attacks always deal at least two damage, even when they miss.
- **Gunner** - If you make only one attack during a turn, and it uses **{Firearms}** it ignores action penalty.

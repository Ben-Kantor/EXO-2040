## Smuggling
In the year 2040, the largest criminal industry in the solar system is smuggling. Most world have strict import policies, banning the import of certain materials, requiring a license for others, but taxing the majority of them. Smuggler ships have to strike a balance of carrying as much cargo as they can, but still being light enough to outrun an armed customs ship if necessary. Restricted technologies, particularly Martian psionic conductors and banned House Scalerium cybernetics also command high prices on the black markets of Earth and Venus. 
## Information Theft
Scientific research is often extremely expensive and time consuming, and for that reason whenever a breakthrough is made, attempts to steal it will almost always begin. Even if no major discoveries have been made, many governments will pay for up to date information on the activities of research labs in rival worlds. 
## Mineral Theft
Every resource-rich asteroid in the inner solar system is claimed, and many have defence systems. And the belt houses which own many of the asteroids have patrol ships that constantly scan for unoccupied residents. But the resources inside often make it worth it to attempt to drill out their mineral-rich cores without permission. This involves disabling security systems that would send a distress beacon, hauling in heavy mining equipment, and then flying off all the equipment and resources within a few days before another patrol ship passes.
## Substances Trade
The most notorious illegal substance is Wormoss spores from Venus, known as "Worm" on the streets. Other common contraband includes Jovian fungal extracts, Europan deep-water compounds, and various synthetic drugs produced in hidden labs throughout the system. Most substances are transported in small, fast ships that can easily evade customs, but some are hidden within legitimate cargo ships, often even without the knowledge of the crew.
## Identity Forgery
With the Universal Implant system controlling much of human society, there's a thriving black market for forged identities. Criminal specialists can modify or clone implants, though the process is dangerous and expensive. Some outlaws choose to remove their implants entirely, though this makes it nearly impossible to access legal markets and services.
## Piracy
While rare in the inner system due to strong naval presence, piracy flourishes from the belt and out. Pirates target cargo ships, mining operations, and isolated settlements. Some pirate groups have grown powerful enough to control entire asteroids or small moons, particularly in Jupiter's outer satellite system.
## Contract Crime
Professional criminals-for-hire offer services ranging from theft to sabotage to assassination. Their main operation, however, is espionage. Various Houses of the Belt will hire them to spy on or even interfere with the operations of rival houses. Many operate through legitimate-seeming businesses in the Belt, using complex networks of intermediaries to maintain deniability.

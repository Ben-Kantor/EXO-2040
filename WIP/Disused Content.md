# Psionics
## Psionic Pulse
#### Level 1
"You can take 1d6 damage to emit a short-range psionic shockwave (5m radius) that forces all creatures to succeed a difficulty 10 Prs check or gain disadvantage on all checks next turn."
#### Level 2
"Characters that fail to resist your psionic pulse also take the same amount of damage you took."
#### Level 3
"Your pulse doesn't effect allies, and disrupts electronic systems within 5m, forcing them offline for 1 minute unless shielded."

## Delusion
#### Level 1
"As an action, vanish or conjure an object into a personal extra-dimensional 50cm cube"
#### Level 2
"With a successful difficulty 10 psionics check, you can create minor, stationary sensory illusions (e.g., sounds, lights, smells), up to 1m cubed in size. These last for 1 minute."
#### Level 3
"You can create any convincing mental illusions directly in a target's mind for one minute by succeeding a psionics check against them, but must rest before using this ability again."

# Items
